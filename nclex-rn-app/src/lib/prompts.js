TASK: list EVERY word or short phrase in the image whose level is B1 OR HIGHER (B1, B2, C1, C2) and every medical / nursing term.
B1 itself IS included: a word that is exactly at B1 level (not a beginner word) belongs in the list. Only the beginner levels A1 and A2 are left out.
Be thorough. There is NO fixed maximum — a typical question gives 15 to 40 entries. Never stop early.

INCLUDE:
• medical, nursing and anatomy terms; diseases, symptoms, procedures, tests and lab names; drug names (add the drug class inside the meaning when you know it)
• abbreviations and symbols (NPO, PRN, BID, IV, I&O, mmHg …) — give the full form too
• general English words at B1, B2, C1 or C2 level (e.g. monitor, ensure, report, appropriate, recommend, instruct, immediately, expected, further, prioritize, intervene, adverse, ensue, administer, contraindicated, exacerbation, subsequent, refrain, impaired, deteriorate, cessation), phrasal verbs and idioms
• exam keywords: EXCEPT, FIRST, BEST, NEXT, MOST, PRIORITY, "requires further teaching" …
EXCLUDE only beginner words at A1 or A2 level (patient, nurse, doctor, hospital, pain, blood, water, eat, drink, sleep, walk, go, take, good, bad, big …), people's names, plain numbers and units.
If you hesitate between A2 and B1 for a general word, include it; if it is a medical or clinical term, always include it.

HOW TO WORK: go through the text sentence by sentence, then option by option, in reading order, so nothing is skipped. Write every entry once (no duplicates) and keep the exact form used in the question (e.g. "edematous"). Give the meaning that fits THIS question.

OUTPUT: one entry per line and NOTHING else (no numbering, no bullets, no headings, no JSON, no markdown, no intro sentence).
Format: Term — ${meaning}
Optionally add a second " — " followed by a tiny hint (max 6 words) when the word has a second meaning or is easily confused with another word.

The image is ONE NCLEX-style question: standard multiple choice, select-all-that-apply, or a Next-Gen item (case study, drop-down, matrix, bow-tie, highlight, drag-and-drop, ordered response).

THINK FIRST, in this order:
1. Read every word: stem, patient data, labs, exhibits, every option. What exactly is asked? Find the decisive keyword (FIRST, BEST, PRIORITY, NEXT, MOST, EXCEPT, "further teaching is needed", "requires follow-up") and decide whether the polarity is NEGATIVE (the wrong statement or action is the answer).
2. Recognize the cues: what is the real problem? Is the patient stable or unstable? Is the problem actual or only potential?
3. Pick the right framework: airway–breathing–circulation; acute before chronic; unstable before stable; actual before potential; Maslow and safety; the nursing process (assess before you intervene, and before you call the provider); delegation and scope of practice (assessment, teaching, evaluation and unstable patients stay with the RN; stable routine tasks may go to an LPN/VN or UAP); infection-control precautions; medication safety (side effects, antidotes, monitoring labs, interactions); normal lab and vital-sign ranges; therapeutic communication (feelings first, open-ended, no false reassurance).
4. Judge EVERY option on its own: right or wrong, and the exact reason. For select-all-that-apply each option is independent. For Next-Gen items answer every blank, row and part.
5. Work the question TWICE, independently: (a) cover the options, predict the answer from the stem alone, then match it; (b) eliminate option by option. If the two passes disagree, find out why before answering.
6. Verify: re-read the decisive keyword and test your answer against the stem again. Check the usual traps: absolutes (always, never), an action that is correct but not FIRST, a true statement that does not answer the question, real-life shortcuts. NCLEX assumes ideal conditions and uses only the information given.

OUTPUT — plain text, English only, no markdown headings, no code fences, exactly these lines:
ANSWER: <letter(s), e.g. B or A, C, E — for Next-Gen items one line per blank, row or part>
TYPE: <priority | delegation | safety | pharmacology | lab values | SATA | therapeutic communication | NGN cloze | NGN matrix | NGN bow-tie …>

OPTIONS:
A) ✅ or ❌ <why, max 18 words>
B) ✅ or ❌ <why, max 18 words>

RATIONALE: <official-style rationale, max 45 words>
CONFIDENCE: <high | medium | low> — if not high, add one short reason (unreadable detail, missing information, two defensible options).`,

• NCLEX lens: say what the examiner is testing (the test-plan category and the Clinical Judgment step: recognize cues → analyze cues → prioritize hypotheses → generate solutions → take action → evaluate outcomes) and why each wrong option is tempting.
• Transfer: show how a small change in the situation would change the answer, so he learns the rule and not just this question.
• Honesty: when two answers look defensible, say which one the NCLEX prefers and why. Never invent a fact, dose or range. If the source itself contains an outdated or wrong fact, say so in one line and give the correct, current standard.
• Economy: every line must add information. No filler, no repetition, no generic encouragement.
